# pi-ext

Personal collection of extensions and skills for [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi). Forked from [tomsej/pi-ext](https://github.com/tomsej/pi-ext).

## Install

```bash
pi install git:github.com/wokoman/pi-ext
```

## Extensions

### [Leader Key](extensions/leader-key/)

Press `Ctrl+X` to open a floating command palette — like Vim's which-key or Emacs' leader key. Actions are organized into single-character groups (`s` for Session, `m` for Model, `f` for Favourites, `t` for Thinking level, `l` for Labels). Auto-discovers extension commands and merges them with built-in actions.

Includes sub-modules:
- **Model Switcher** — searchable provider → model → thinking level picker
- **Favourite Models** — quick-switch to preset model+thinking combos via `favourite-models.json`
- **Session / Label Actions** — rename, archive, label, and jump between sessions

### [Custom Footer](extensions/custom-footer/)

Compact powerline-style status bar showing working directory, git branch, token usage, cost, context window utilization, and active model.

### [Tool Pills](extensions/tool-pills/)

Compact colored pill labels for built-in tools with collapsed output, plus Shiki-powered syntax-highlighted diffs for `write` and `edit`.

### [Code Review](extensions/review/)

`/review` command with multiple modes: review a GitHub PR, diff against a base branch, review uncommitted changes, review a specific commit, or provide custom review instructions. When `pi-sem` is also loaded, `/review` nudges the agent toward a semantic workflow.

### [pi-sem](extensions/pi-sem/)

Semantic git tooling powered by [sem](https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/sem). Entity-aware tools — `sem_diff`, `sem_impact`, `sem_context`, `sem_log`, `sem_entities`, `sem_blame`, and `sem_eval`.

### [Session Snap](extensions/session-snap/)

Session archiver and cleaner. `/snap` scans all sessions, classifies them, and lets you review before executing. `/archive` browses archived sessions with search, restore, and permanent delete.

### [Session Query](extensions/session-query/)

Tool for querying previous pi sessions for context, decisions, or code changes.

### [Permissions](extensions/permissions/)

Three-mode permission system: `yolo`, `safe`, `read-only`. `/mode` to switch. Rules merge project → global → built-ins.

### [Ask User Question](extensions/ask-user-question/)

Registers an `ask_user_question` tool for structured clarifying questions with interactive UI.
